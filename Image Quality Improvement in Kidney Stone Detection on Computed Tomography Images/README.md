# Image Quality Improvement in Kidney Stone Detection on Computed Tomography Images

## Abstract

Any Biological image obtained from various devices contains a lot of noise. This noise can be in any form(i.e salt-pepper noise, blurred). Sometimes the images are poorly contrasted or the region of interest is not clear, for that we use Image processing technique. In this term paper we will be enhancing the CT scan of the kidney to detect stone. We will be using Python openCV for image preprocessing, since it is free and open source.
