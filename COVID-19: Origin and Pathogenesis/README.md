# COVID-19: Origin and Pathogenesis

## Abstract
The __COVID-19__ _(stand for __“coronavirus disease”__ and 19 is the year this pandemic started,2019)_ pandemic is among one of the deadliest infectious diseases in recent history`(Morens et al. 2020)`. What makes it different from other viruses  was the specific mechanism for its emergence in humans remains unknown. A virus similar to the SARS COV-2(the pathogen causing the virus) has been discovered in bat of the genus Rhinolophus and in the Sunda pangolin(_Mantis javanica_)`(Desmarest 1822)`. It suggests that animals have played a key role in spreading this outbreak. The first case was noticed in the wet market of Wuhan,China in November 2019.  It is found that viruses can either be directly transmitted from bats(Rhinolophus) or by oral consumption or by the moisture created by the hound of Bat which is likely possible. But since it was started in the month of November it was quite unsure that bat consumption should be considered. As the size of bats are very small and generally not preferred for market. Now we found many evidence of poaching and smuggling of Pangolin(_Manis javanica_) in the area from China to Myanmar `(Hassanin et al. 2021)`. It can be another point which we can consider. Pangolin are the mammals which are believed to live separately so it is hard that they might get the infection in a crowd rather than one of theory suggest it is possible while smuggling they came in contact with Bat. Another theory suggests that they might have eaten the flesh of bats from the cave. Through smuggling it reaches a wet market and finally the consumption of Pangolin makes it  enter the Human. Throughout this paper we will be discovering many aspects on how the virus breaks and from where it originally originated. We will also consider the available data for Sarbecoviruses(virus related to SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2) to propose all the hypotheses related to the Origin of COVID-19. Apart from discovering its origin we will also look at how much it is related with the present Human Coronavirus strains. Further we will study about the important component of this virus which is of course the pathogenesis of it. We will look into how much it is different from the other coronavirus in terms of mutation. At last we will see how we can identify important signatures that can significantly different under therapeutic(drug)  treatment and untreated condition

## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

__Coronavirus__ are the viruses known for having the longest genome of all the known RNA- viruses. It has a crown like structure, from where it is given the name corona(is a latin word of crown). These are the spike proteins on the exterior. Previously this virus was known for mostly affecting Birds or small mammals but as we can see now it has the ability to have human to human transmission. In humans and Birds, they cause respiratory tract infection, this can be mild, but can be lethal at some instances`(Fouchier et al. 2004)`. Mild illness shows the symptoms of Cold, many articles claim that the cold having dry cough are the most out of them. But there are many exceptional cases already present which show the number of patients having wet coughs and still infected. On rare occasions, gastrointestinal coronavirus infection has been associated with the outbreak of diarrhoea in children`(Tyrrell and Myint 2011)`.

Based on the cell that is likely infected it is classified into three different phases corresponding to different stages of the disease`(Wu and McGoogan 2020)`.The early phase of Asymptotic state[__initial 1-2 days__] where SARS-CoV-2 inhaled virus binds to epithelial cells in the nasal cavity and begins replicating. __SARS-CoV2__ and __SARS-CoV__ both use the __ACE2__ receptor . The ciliated cells are main cells infected in the conducting airways, according to in vitro data with SARS-CoV. The virus is circulating locally, but there is only a small innate immune response. Nasal swabs will diagnose the virus at this point.These people are contagious, even though their viral burden is minimal. The viral RNA __RT-PCR__ value can be useful in predicting viral load, eventual infectivity, and clinical path.These experiments could be able to detect super spreaders`(Mason 2020)`. The sample selection protocol will have to be standardised for the RT-PCR period number to be meaningful. Swabs from the nose can be more susceptible than swabs from the throat.

In the second phase The virus spreads and migrates down the respiratory tract, causing a more intense innate immune response.The virus (SARS-CoV-2) as well as initial markers of the innate immune response can be included in nasal swabs or sputum. The disordered __COVID-19__ is now scientifically manifest. __CXCL10__ (or another innate response cytokine) level can be representative of potential clinical outcomes`(Sims et al. 2005; Hoffmann et al. 2020)`. Beta and lambda interferons are formed in large amounts by virally infected epithelial cells. __CXCL10__ is an interferon-responsive gene that has a high signal-to-noise ratio in the response of alveolar type II cells to __SARS-CoV__ and __influenza__. __CXCL10__ has also been proposed as a disease marker in the case of SARS. Determining the host's innate immune response may help foresee the disease's future path and the need for more active control.

But most of the people enter the third stage and develop pulmonary infiltrates, with some developing life-threatening disease. Its response varies with the age group. Once the prevalence of mild and asymptomatic cases is better described, the fatality and morbidity rates can be updated.The virus has now infiltrated alveolar type II cells in the lung's gas exchange units. In comparison to type I cells, __SARS-CoV__ and influenza preferentially infect type II cells. The infected alveolar units are usually found on the periphery and in the centrilobular space. `(Okada et al. 2007; Hoffmann et al. 2020; Mason 2020)`__SARS-CoV__ replicates in type II cells, releasing a large number of viral particles before the cells die of apoptosis. As far age is concerned because of their weakened immune responses and decreased ability to repair damaged epithelia, the elderly are especially vulnerable. The elderly also have lower mucociliary clearance, which could make it easier for the virus to spread to the lung's gas exchange units.

We understand the different stages of the transmission as well as replication of the virus, these viruses are normally spread by droplets in the air (coughing, sneezing). Oral-fecal transmission experiments have recently been launched to see whether viral shedding from asymptomatic patients can induce transmission without coughing or sneezing. Virus transmission and the risk of transmission without direct contact have several aspects.

The virus is really not alive; it's just a chunk of grease with a chromosome within. Only a compatible host would be able to use this genome or in other sense we can say it will infect or can survive in a particular specific host. As a result, the virus's genome(a sequence of letters containing all of the knowledge) required to replicate and assemble a virus, is at its heart. Before we begin searching for this sequence, it's important to note that COVID-19 is caused by a particular type of virus known as a "positive strand RNA virus" based on the way this information is collected.

SARS-COV2 is a single-strand RNA virus, which means it doesn't store the genetic material in DNA but instead in a single strand of RNA. Since RNA viruses have a higher mutation rate than DNA viruses, they are the most prevalent cause of emerging diseases in humans.As compared to RNA, DNA is a much more stable macromolecule. RNA viruses use virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to copy their genomes __(RdRp)__.The RNA genome serves as a blueprint for the development of new RNA strands. At least three types of RNA must be synthesised during RNA virus replication: the genome, a copy of the genome (reference genome), and mRNAs. Some RNA viruses, along with coronaviruses, make subgenomic mRNA copies as well. Positive-sense RNA viruses (abbreviated __+ssRNA__) are viruses with __ssRNA__ genomes that can act as mRNA directly. Negative-sense RNA viruses, on the other hand, are ssRNA viruses with genomes that cannot be directly translated by ribosomes and are instead used as a basis for mRNA processing (abbreviated -ssRNA). __+ssRNA__ viruses infect a wide variety of host species and are more widespread than any other virus family. These include seven separate human viral families that cause major disease in humans, such as coronaviruses, flaviviruses, and picornaviruses`(Crowe 2004; Desforges et al. 2019; Firth et al. 2014)`. Since the genome of __+ssRNA__ viruses functions as __mRNA__, they provide contagious genetic material. Their genomes have 5′-caps (or proteins that behave similarly to a 5′-cap) and poly(A) tail sequences at the 3′-end, and are translated by host ribosomes.
